# algorithms

This is a collection of algorithms that I developed, the core of which were done for freeCodeCamp's challenges.

## Sources

-   basic: [Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/)
-   intermediate: [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/)
-   projects: [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/)

## Built with

-   ES6 JavaScript
-   Node.js
-   Mocha and Chai

## To do:

-   [ ] Finish formating of README and app files for intermediary challenges
-   [ ] Update the algorithms so they comply with functional programming principles
-   [ ] Implement true testing
